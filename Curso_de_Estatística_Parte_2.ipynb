    "A **Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios - PNAD** investiga anualmente, de forma permanente, características gerais da população, de educação, trabalho, rendimento e habitação e outras, com periodicidade variável, de acordo com as necessidades de informação para o país, como as características sobre migração, fecundidade, nupcialidade, saúde, segurança alimentar, entre outros temas. O levantamento dessas estatísticas constitui, ao longo dos 49 anos de realização da pesquisa, um importante instrumento para formulação, validação e avaliação de políticas orientadas para o desenvolvimento socioeconômico e a melhoria das condições de vida no Brasil."
